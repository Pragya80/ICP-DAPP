# üöö Product Transfer Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you test the complete product transfer functionality in your ICP Supply Chain dApp. The system now supports transferring products through the supply chain: **Manufacturer ‚Üí Distributor ‚Üí Retailer ‚Üí Customer**.

## üîß Prerequisites

1. **Backend deployed and running**:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

2. **Frontend running**:

   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Multiple browser sessions/profiles** (to simulate different users)

## üß™ Step-by-Step Testing

- Open browser session 1 (or incognito)
- Navigate to your dApp
- Register as: **Name**: "ABC Manufacturing", **Role**: "Manufacturer"
- **Copy your Principal ID** from Dashboard (click the copy button)
- Keep this ID handy - others will need it

#### 1.2 Create Distributor User  
- Open browser session 2 (different profile/incognito)
- Register as: **Name**: "XYZ Distribution", **Role**: "Distributor"
- **Copy your Principal ID** from Dashboard
- Keep this ID handy

#### 1.3 Create Retailer User
- Open browser session 3
- Register as: **Name**: "Best Retail Store", **Role**: "Retailer"

- Keep this ID handy

#### 1.4 Create Customer User

#### 2.2 Transfer: Manufacturer ‚Üí Distributor
**In Manufacturer session:**
1. Find your created product
2. Click **"Transfer Product"** button
3. In transfer form:
   - **Distributor Principal ID**: Paste the Distributor's Principal ID
   - **Description**: "Wholesale transfer to distributor"

- **Expected**: No transfer button should appear
- **In Customer session**: Try to transfer the product you received
- **Expected**: No transfer button should appear (customers can't transfer)

#### 3.2 Test Product ID Copying
**In any session:**

2. Click **"Copy"** button next to your Principal ID
3. Paste somewhere to verify full ID was copied
4. ‚úÖ **Verify**: Full Principal ID should be copied to clipboard

#### 3.4 Test Invalid Principal ID
